# Counselor Chatbot

This repository contains the code and resources for a counselor chatbot developed using Python. The chatbot is designed to interact with users and provide responses based on predefined conversational intents. This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and leverages various machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

## Project Overview

The Counselor Chatbot project includes the following key components:

- **Data Processing:** Loading and processing conversational data stored in JSON format.
- **Intent Classification:** Using patterns in the data to classify user inputs into predefined intents.
- **Response Generation:** Generating appropriate responses based on the identified intent.
- **Model Training:** Training a machine learning model to improve the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to user queries.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to have Python 3 installed along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow` or `keras`
- `nltk`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow nltk
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/precioux/counselor-chatbot.git
   cd counselor-chatbot
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `counseler-chatbot.ipynb` file.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook counseler-chatbot.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run the Cells:**

   Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the data, process it, and train the model.

4. **Interacting with the Chatbot:**

   Once the model is trained, you can interact with the chatbot directly in the notebook.

## Data

The conversational data used for this project is stored in a JSON file named `intents.json`. This file includes various intents, each with its own set of patterns (user inputs) and corresponding responses.
